### Advent of Code 2020

Every year (since 2015), on December, [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl) releases daily challenges for developers around the world to have fun with. He calls it The [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).

>Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

In 2020 I decided, alongside my friend [Gabriel Luz](https://github.com/gabrielluz), to go on this journey, not to challenge each other, but to challenge ourselves together to improve our knowledge on OOP, TDD, DDD and problem solving.

This repository is our take on the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020) challenges. We focused on solving these problems applying our software engineering knowledge and promoting discussions around the problem's domain.

### Technologies

The challenges were solved using [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), alongside [Jest](https://jestjs.io) for testing.

***Note**: Node version should be v14.14.0 or higher in order for [fs.rmSync](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_rmsync_path_options) to work.*

### Scripts
- `npm start`: Runs all challenges
- `npm test`: Tests all challenges
- `npm lint:fix`: Lints all files

If you want to try your own challenges' inputs, please put them inside the `inputs` folder, following the naming convention there `<exercise number>.txt`.
